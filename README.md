# Media Buffet: A Multi Media Search Tool Application
Version 1.0
This is a website that can search movies, books, and video games to find like material.
For example: Really enjoy the Thor movies? Want to learn what books and games are out there featuring the characters from Thor? Search by keyword Thor to get back multiple multi-media results based on the character Thor. 

The User Interface:
The landing page contains a search bar, dropdown menu to select your search criteria (title or keyword), radio buttons to select your options, and a submit button that renders the results based on the user's selections.

At the bottom of the page there are collapsible elements that the results are generated into, broken down by selection (Movies, Books, Games). When results are generated into the collabisble they are automatically set to open and there is a badge at the top that (ideally) brings back the number of search results.
